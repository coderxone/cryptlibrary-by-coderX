### Update added

easy update


### Usage

first set your key inside gencrypt module -> config/config.js folder

you will find this line or you can search in your IDE by name "cryptKey" to find file
const cryptKey = "new key"; //change this line
const cryptKey = "your key"; //to this




To encrypt js object
const gencrypt = require('gencrypt');

 console.log(gencrypt.encrypt({
     'keycode':'FCE',
    'firstname':'abc',
     'lastname':'234'
 }))

 to decrypt encrypted message use

let encryptedString = 'U2FsdGVkX1/j16TTXF86LIDKP/ipy3yU8MDYggf+17FLPTKY+SB/EsnEeldtm1TvrhnYMRb0vNS4ZSzSNYwoRLIHOVuuWtMCPSdBBRMp2rE=';

 console.log(gencrypt.decrypt(encryptedString));

//{ keycode: 'FCE', firstname: 'abc', lastname: '234' }



## Node.js (Install)

Requirements:

- Node.js
- npm (Node.js package manager)

```bash
npm install gencrypt
```



ES6 import for typical API call signing use case:

```javascript
import {encrypt, decrypt} from 'gencrypt';

let obj = encrypt({
    name:name
});

let decryptobj = decrypt('incoming string');

or
 
const gencrypt = require('gencrypt');
gencrypt.crypt({
    name:name
})

gencrypt.decrypt("incoming encrypted string")
